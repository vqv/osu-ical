# Ohio State University Academic iCal Feed

This is a simple Python script that generates an iCal feed for the Ohio State 
University academic calendar and generates an iCal feed. This is based on [github.com/McManning/ohio-state-ics](https://github.com/McManning/ohio-state-ics). The 
main difference is that this script fetches events directly using an 
undocumented REST API at 
`https://registrar.osu.edu/umbraco/api/calendar/getentries` rather than scraping  
[registrar.osu.edu/academic-calendar](https://registrar.osu.edu/academic-calendar).

## Usage
